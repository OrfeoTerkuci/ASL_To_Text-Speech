    Hand tracking is one of the most important parts of our project. 
    This combines the visual image of the hand and the model we created.\\
    \\
    We make use of OpenCV\cite{l0} and MediaPipe\cite{l2} to track the hand.
    We start by capturing the video feed from the camera, and then we use the hand tracking model from MediaPipe to track the hand.
    OpenCV helps us to process the image before we do anything with it.\\
    \\
    We also make use of MediaPipe to help us track/calculate the landmarks of the hand.
