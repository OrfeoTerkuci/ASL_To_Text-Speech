    ASL (American sign language) to text conversion is a very important task, as it can help people with hearing disabilities to communicate with people who do not know sign language.
    While technology has advanced a lot in the last years, there are still many challenges in this field.
    According to the World Health Organization, Over 5\% of the world's population - or 430 million people - require rehabilitation to address their disabling hearing loss (including 34 million children).
    It is estimated that by 2050 over 700 million people - or 1 in every 10 people - will have disabling hearing loss.\cite{i0}.
    This is why it is important to develop technology that can help people with hearing disabilities to communicate with people who do not know sign language.
    In this paper we will discuss our process of creating a model that can translate American Sign Language (ASL) and the challenges we faced to make a closer step to achieve this goal.
