    So, let's talk about the implemented GUI.\@
    \subsection{Customtkinter}
    Customtkinter is a open-source library that provides a set of custom widgets for Tkinter. 
    It is a wrapper around Tkinter that provides a set of custom widgets that are not available in Tkinter.
    We used this library to create the GUI for our project because it is easy to use and provides us with a small interface that 
    easily displays our implemented features.
    \subsection{Features}
    The GUI has a few features that showcase our project. The main features are:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Loading a implemented model (CNN).
        \item Handtracking using your webcam.
    \end{itemize}
    The Handtracking feature uses the MediaPipe and OpenCV library to track the hand and display the landmarks on the screen,
    More about the hand tracking is discussed in the hand tracking section. If you want to know more about the models you can 
    also read the corresponding section.
